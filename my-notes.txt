        list-style: none;

*   I looked up 'textarea' and the first result was https://css-tricks.com/textarea-tricks/. There are various things that you can do with
    text, for instance:

        1.  Image as textarea background, disappears when text is entered.
        2.  HTML5 placeholder text
        3.  Placeholder text, HTML5 with jQuery fallback
        4.  Remove the blue glow
        5.  Remove resize handle
        6.  Add resize handle
        7.  Auto-resize to fit content
        8.  Nowrap
        9.  Remove default scrollbars in Internet Explorer
